# ![Safia Logo](logo.png) Safia — Federal Contract Matchmaking for SMEs
[Visit Safia Website](https://usesafia.com/)

## Overview
Safia was a government contracting matchmaking platform operating from **June 2025 to November 2025**, focused exclusively on **federal contracts**. The platform helped small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) discover, qualify for, and match with relevant federal contracting opportunities.

Safia was built to reduce the information asymmetry and overhead that prevents SMEs from participating effectively in federal procurement.

**Status:** Sunset  
**Operational Period:** June 2025 – November 2025  
**Scope:** U.S. Federal Government Contracts

## What Safia Did

- Matched SMEs to relevant federal contract opportunities
- Filtered opportunities based on business size, capabilities, and eligibility
- Provided structured contract discovery beyond basic RFP search
- Enabled consistent monthly deal flow for participating businesses

---

## Key Metrics (During Operation)

- **~30 contract matches per month**
- **1,000+ total federal contracts matched**
- **$1M+ in aggregate contract value surfaced**
- **Served SMEs across 10+ U.S. states**
- **Federal-only focus (no state/local contracts)**

---

## What Safia Did *Not* Do

- Act as a bidding agent or lobbyist  
- Influence procurement decisions  
- Charge contingency fees tied to contract awards  
- Guarantee contract wins  

Safia operated strictly as a **matching and discovery platform**, not a procurement intermediary.

---

## Target Users

- Small and medium-sized businesses entering or expanding in federal contracting
- Capability-driven firms lacking dedicated government sales teams
- SMEs overwhelmed by SAM.gov complexity and unstructured RFP feeds

---

## Product Scope

- Federal opportunity aggregation
- SME–contract relevance matching
- Eligibility-aware filtering
- Lightweight onboarding for SMEs

---

## Limitations

- No bid writing or proposal automation
- No teaming/primes marketplace
- No post-award workflow support
- Limited historical performance data integration

Safia validated **demand and engagement**, but did not reach full product depth before being sunset.

---

## Outcome

Safia demonstrated that:
- SMEs want **curated, relevance-based** access to federal opportunities
- Raw RFP search is insufficient for small operators
- Match quality matters more than volume

The project was discontinued to focus on other ventures.
